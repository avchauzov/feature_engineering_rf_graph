# Feature Engineering with RandomForest and Graph Theory

## Introduction

This project aims to enhance machine learning models through feature engineering using RandomForest and graph theory techniques.

## Development Roadmap

- [ ] **Expand Paths Calculation:**
  Expand paths calculation to cover the entire RandomForest, aggregating results for comprehensive feature analysis.

- [ ] **Replace Weights:**
  Replace weights with more reliable indicators related to the target variable for improved feature significance.

- [ ] **Process Features:**
  Process features, aggregating them into bins for efficient utilization in the model.

- [ ] **Test on Random Dataset:**
  Evaluate model accuracy on a random dataset to ensure robust performance.

- [ ] **Expand to Regression Task:**
  Extend the approach to regression tasks for broader applicability.
